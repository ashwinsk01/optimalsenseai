## 🔍 **Progressive Assessment Technology**

### **⚡ Efficient Questioning (Maximum 5-6 Questions)**

Our proprietary questioning algorithm maximizes information extraction while minimizing user burden:

```
Traditional Approach (8-12 questions):          Smart Approach (3-5 questions):
❌ "When did this start?"                       ✅ "When did this start, how severe 
❌ "How severe is it?"                             is it out of 10, and have you
❌ "Any other symptoms?"                           noticed any other symptoms?"
❌ "Previous medical history?"                  ✅ "Have you experienced this before,
❌ "Any treatments received?"                      and if so, are you still following
❌ "Currently taking medications?"                 any treatment you were given?"
```

### **🎯 Three-Phase Assessment**

| Phase | Purpose | Duration | Questions |
|-------|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Context Gathering** | Symptom description + immediate history | 1-2 exchanges | 1-2 questions |
| **Targeted Assessment** | Risk stratification + treatment history | 2-3 exchanges | 2-3 questions |
| **Final Clarification** | Essential details for care pathway | 0-1 exchanges | 0-1 questions |

- **Smart Filtering**: Avoids unnecessary queries for obvious conditions or emergencies
- **Evidence Weighting**: Prioritizes NHS-validated care pathways over general medical knowledge

### **🛡️ Safety Mechanisms**

- **Immediate Escalation Protocols**: Automatic 999 routing for life-threatening symptoms
- **Conservative Bias**: Always errs on the side of caution for uncertain cases
- **Multi-Layer Validation**: Cross-references symptoms against emergency criteria
- **Transparent Limitations**: Clear disclaimers about AI assessment scope

## 🎭 **Demo Scenario: Progressive Assessment in Action**

### **Real-World Example: Sports Injury Follow-up**

**Context**: User with previous rugby neck injury, stopped physiotherapy, experiencing symptom recurrence.

```
👤 User: "I have neck pain for the past couple days and my head is spinning"

🤖 AI: "Neck pain with dizziness can be concerning. Have you had neck problems 
       before, and if so, are you still doing any exercises or treatment you 
       were given?"

👤 User: "I hurt my neck playing rugby a few months ago and had physio but 
        stopped the exercises"

🤖 AI: "That's likely connected - stopping physio exercises often causes 
       symptoms to return. I'd recommend restarting those exercises and 
       monitoring your progress. If pain worsens or you develop severe symptoms:
       
       📞 Contact NHS 111"
```

### **🧠 Behind the Scenes Intelligence**

1. **Context Recognition**: Identifies potential previous injury pattern
2. **Treatment History Discovery**: Efficiently uncovers stopped physiotherapy  
3. **Pattern Matching**: Connects symptom recurrence to treatment cessation
4. **Conservative Recommendation**: Suggests resuming proven treatment
